First team app off App Academy bootcamp course made in collaboration with Alyson Vivattanapa 

The lekker app was the first team app written within the App Academy Bootcamp. Over a period of time of three weeks we designed it and wrote the code to get it working. The only requirements set by the App Academy were that it should contain a map, a list and a image picker. 

We decided to build an app in which you could share anything #Lekker within three categories and also use these categories to update the map.
